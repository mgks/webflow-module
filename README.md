# Webflow Module
A repo that homes all the steps (required/optional) to build a well documented website project.

One way to build a website is just sit on a chair and hit the framework and get done with stylesheets, the other way is to do it all professionally or to say in a clean, commented and curated way. Just a few benefits of it &minus;
- Clear timeline and objective of the idea/project
- Sharper customer/user persona visibility (if any)
- Easier to collaborate for teams
- Whoever reads it will know what's where in the source code
- Everything become pluggable automatically
